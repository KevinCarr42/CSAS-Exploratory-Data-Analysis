Hi Jenni, 
For the toad crab request, it is not a priority for 2023-24, so it can be deferred to 2024-25  and we will re-assess it’s need at the next round of request.

Eels is still a secondary fishery in the region and provides supplemental income. One of the main questions that is not in the request for the advice was to confirm that we don't have any accumulation of elvers in the region and that is why we don't have an elver fishery.

To get the data will require various group to work together.
